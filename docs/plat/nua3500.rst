NUVOTON NUA3500 
=================

Trusted Firmware-A supports Nuvoton ARM SoC AARCH64 fields.
nua3500: dual-core Cortex-A35


Boot Sequence
-------------

Bootrom -> BL2 (compiled with BL2_AT_EL3) -> BL31 -> OP-TEE -> BL31 --> BL33(u-boot)

How to build
------------

Build Procedure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Prepare AARCH64 toolchain.

-  Build optee (BL32) and u-boot (BL33) firstly, and get binary images: tee-pager_v2.bin and u-boot.bin

-  Build TF-A

   Build bl2 and bl31:

   .. code:: shell

       CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- make PLAT=nua3500 bl2 bl31

How to deploy
-------------

Both upstream U-Boot and OPTEE projects contain instructions on where
to put the built images during their respective build process.
So after successfully building TF-A just follow their build instructions
to continue.
